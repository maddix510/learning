# Lesson 1: Printing and Comments (with blank lines)
# print ("") is how you get Python to say what you want, you type what ever you want in the "" and it'll say it in the terminal
# tpye \n at the end of what your saying but still in the "" to create a space in between your lines (do this everytime you want to create a space in between your lines)

print ("Hello, world!\n")
print ("My name is Maddix\n")
print ("I'm learning Python step by step\n")
print ("My favorite game is Borderlands 2\n")
print ("One day I want to make my own game\n")
